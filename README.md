# GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Test

We are very thankful that you decided to apply for our job opening. In this
first test, we are going over some small JavaScript challenges. We encourage you
to use ES6, ES7 or beyond, but it is not necessary. These questions are mostly
focused on manipulating data, and handling asychronous tasks. There is only one
constraint, you are not allowed to use **Libraries** or **Frameworks** in this
test (Unless we ask you to do so). Feel free to ask us questions, should you have any.

### Instructions

1. Inside this repository, you will find 5 questions, 2 of them are optional:
    * Question_1.md
    * Question_2.md
    * Question_3.md
    * Bonus_1.md (optional)
    * Bonus_2.md (optional)

2. Read each question carefully, create a separated folder, and write your answers. Here are some formats that you can follow:
    ```
    Answers/
    |-- Answer_1.js
    |-- Answer_2.js
    |-- Answer_2.js
    ```
    Or if you want to write some tests:
    ```
    Answers/
    |-- Answer_1/
        |-- answer.js
        |-- answer.test.js
    |-- Answer_2.md
        |-- answer.js
        |-- answer.test.js
    |-- Answer_2.md
        |-- answer.js
        |-- answer.test.js
    ```
    **Note**: You are allowed to use frameworks to write tests (chai, mocha, jest, etc.).

3. To submit your answers, you can simply send us a `Answers.zip` file using dropbox /
   google drive. Make sure to give us the right permissions, and enough time to
   access the files. You don't have to include the questions on your `.zip`
   file, only the answers is fine.
